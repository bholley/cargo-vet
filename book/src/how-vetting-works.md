# How Vetting Works

This section provides additional detail on the mechanics of `cargo vet`.

## Scope

When vetting dependencies, `cargo vet` will execute the `cargo metadata`
subcommand to learn about the crate graph. When traversing the graph, `cargo
vet` will enforce audits for all crates.io dependencies.

All other nodes in the graph are considered trusted and therefore non-auditable:

* **Root crates and path dependencies:** The source code is typically in the
  repository and already subject to normal review policies.

* **Git dependencies:** It is expected that git dependencies have a manual
  verification process if necessary, or it's otherwise expected that these are
  typically private git repositories anyway.

* **Non-crates.io registry dependencies:** It's expected that a non-default
  registry is likely private or has its own review and/or publication policies.
  The tool may eventually support this if large public non-crates.io mirrors
  emerge.

## Algorithm

The following is a very simplified sketch of what happens when `cargo vet`
is invoked.

> **Note**: The details here are still being refined as we iterate on the
> implementation, so this section has gaps and may drift out of date.

First, the project's [configuration](./config.md) is be parsed and loaded.

If not running in locked mode, each of the URLs listed in the `imports` key of
`config.toml` is then fetched. These files are then processed and the resulting
data is stored in `imports.lock`. The descriptions for any mapped criteria are
stored as well, and any changes to previously-recorded descriptions will cause
`cargo vet` to fail and require `cargo vet accept-criteria-change` to be run.

`audits.toml`, `imports.lock`, and  `config.toml` are then parsed. If any of the
three are not well-formed, an error is thrown.

Next, the files are ingested in order into a multi-level table, indexed first by
crate name and then by criteria. Each concrete entry contains a list of absolute
versions, a list of version deltas, a list of violation versions. Each insertion
checks for overlap between the set of audited versions and violation versions;
if overlap is created, an error is thrown.

Next, the dependency subtrees of each top-level crate are traversed in accordance
with the policy specified for each crate. TODO: Precisely specify the subtree
traversal algorithm.

If verification fails, an error is generated, along with a list of any versions
of the same crate that would have passed verification. These can be used as
inputs to `cargo vet diff`.

If any entries in `unaudited` are superfluous — i.e. verification would succeed
without them — a warning is generated so that the list can be pared down.
