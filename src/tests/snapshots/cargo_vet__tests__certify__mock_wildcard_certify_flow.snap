<<<EDITING VET_CERTIFY>>>
# Please read the following criteria and then follow the instructions below:

# === BEGIN CRITERIA "safe-to-deploy" ===
#
# This crate will not introduce a serious security vulnerability to production
# software exposed to untrusted input.
#
# Auditors are not required to perform a full logic review of the entire crate.
# Rather, they must review enough to fully reason about the behavior of all unsafe
# blocks and usage of powerful imports. For any reasonable usage of the crate in
# real-world software, an attacker must not be able to manipulate the runtime
# behavior of these sections in an exploitable or surprising way.
#
# Ideally, all unsafe code is fully sound, and ambient capabilities (e.g.
# filesystem access) are hardened against manipulation and consistent with the
# advertised behavior of the crate. However, some discretion is permitted. In such
# cases, the nature of the discretion should be recorded in the `notes` field of
# the audit record.
#
# For crates which generate deployed code (e.g. build dependencies or procedural
# macros), reasonable usage of the crate should output code which meets the above
# criteria.
#
# === END CRITERIA ===
#
# Uncomment the following statement:

# I, testing, certify that any version of third-party1 published by 'testuser' between 2022-12-18 and 2024-01-01 will satisfy the above criteria.

# Add any notes about your audit below this line:
