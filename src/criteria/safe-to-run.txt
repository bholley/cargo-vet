This crate can be compiled, run, and tested on a local workstation or in
controlled automation without surprising consequences, such as:
* Reading or writing data from sensitive or unrelated parts of the filesystem.
* Installing software or reconfiguring the device.
* Connecting to untrusted network endpoints.
* Misuse of system resources (e.g. cryptocurrency mining).
